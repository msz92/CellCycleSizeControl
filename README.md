# CellCycleSizeControl


## The algorithm serves as a small framework for the simulation and monitoring of bacterial cell size statistics over time, with different parameters as cellular growth rate and initial size conditions. Each object represents one bacterial cell inside the growing colony, with size attributes and growth rate attribute, of which the latter is implemented based on a minimal stochastic model. Cell division is implemented using the BCD-model (introduced by Helmstetter et al. 1968).
